# Dorks
This Python script automates Google Dorks generation for a user-specified domain. It replaces "{domain}" in a predefined list of 52 dorks with the input domain, displays the results, and optionally saves them to a file named "&lt;domain>_dorks.txt". Useful for security researchers to find exposed data ethically.
